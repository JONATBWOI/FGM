            <h2>Understanding Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)</h2>
            <p>
                Female Genital Mutilation, also known as female circumcision, comprises various practices involving the partial or total removal of external female genitalia or injury to the female genital organs. FGM is often performed for cultural, religious, or social reasons, with roots in deeply ingrained beliefs about purity, modesty, and societal expectations.

            <h2>Reasons Behind Female Genital Mutilation</h2>
            <p>
                FGM is driven by a complex interplay of cultural, social, and economic factors. Some communities view it as a rite of passage into womanhood, a way to preserve chastity, or a prerequisite for marriage. Misconceptions about hygiene and aesthetics also contribute to the perpetuation of this harmful practice. It's essential to recognize the multifaceted nature of these beliefs to address and dismantle them effectively.
